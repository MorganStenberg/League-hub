### **Validator testing**

I have validated my HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python code with the websites listed below:

 - HTML: [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
 - CSS: [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
 - Javascript: [JShint](https://jshint.com/)
 - Python [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

JShint and W3C did not return any errors for the Javascript and CSS code.

Python Linter did return errors regarding to long lines and trailing whitespaces, which were taken care of by formatting the code correctly and splitting up lines that
were too long.

The HTML validator had issues with the python code mixed in with the HTML, which caused warnings. But no warnings or errors were found other than 
those related to the Python code, as seen in the pictures.
